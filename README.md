# 💊 Drug, Side Effects and Medical Condition Analysis
## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes drugs, their associated medical conditions, and reported side effects using Python. 
The goal is to extract meaningful healthcare insights and present them using visualizations and an interactive dashboard.
## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand relationships between drugs and medical conditions
- Identify commonly treated medical conditions
- Analyze reported side effects
- Visualize healthcare trends
## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about:
- Drug names
- Medical conditions treated
- Reported side effects
## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Streamlit
- VS Code
- GitHub
## 🔍 Project Workflow
1. Data loading and understanding
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Side effect analysis
5. Data visualization
6. Interactive dashboard development
## 📊 Key Insights
- Pain is the most commonly treated medical condition.
- Diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2) appears frequently.
- Certain drugs are associated with multiple side effects.
- Some conditions have limited treatment options.
## 🌐 Streamlit Dashboard
An interactive Streamlit dashboard was developed to explore drugs, medical conditions, and side effects dynamically.
## ⚠️ Limitations
- Dataset size is limited.
- Side effects are self-reported.
- No demographic information available.
## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Add machine learning for drug recommendation
- Perform NLP on side effect text
- Deploy dashboard with additional filters
